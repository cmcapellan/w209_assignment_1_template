      This chart shows my active calories for each week as measured by my Apple Watch starting 
      at the beginning of 2019 (the first week started on 12/30/2018) through the end of
      August 2020.

      Apple defines "Active Calories" as calories burned while actively moving
      around such as when walking or exercising. This metric does not include calories
      from a person's Basal Metabolic Rate (which is based on age, gender, height and weight).
      <br />
      <br />
      The key insight for me is the impact on my activity by the start of the pandemic in March 2020.
      I had big dropoff which I was able to rebound from in April, but then I've
      still trailed off in the summer of 2020.
